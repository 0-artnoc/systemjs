jspm loader
===========

RequireJS-style ES6 dynamic module loader, with out-the-box plugin support.

For the loader documentation read below. For a complete overview of features, see [https://jspm.io](https://jspm.io).

A ~20KB module loader written to work for ES6 modules, but that can load AMD, CommonJS and global scripts detecting the format automatically.

The loader itself is 10KB, and it is built on top of the 11KB [ES6-loader polyfill](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader).

Uses RequireJS-inspired configuration options including baseURL, map, shim and custom paths (locations).

Supported Plugins:

* CSS `jspm.import('my/file.css!')`
* Image `jspm.import('some/image.png!image')`
* JSON `jspm.import('some/data.json!')`
* Text `jspm.import('some/text.txt!text')`

To submit or request a new plugin, create an issue or pull request on the [Plugin Repository](https://github.com/jspm/plugins).

Including
---

Include `es6-loader.js` and `esprima-es6.js` (from [ES6-loader polyfill](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader)) in the same folder as `require-es6.js`.

Then include it with a `<script>` tag:

```html
  <script src="path/to/jspm-loader.js"></script>
```

The 60KB Esprima parser is dynamically included when loading an ES6 module format only.

Without the parser, the polyfill and loader are roughly 20KB combined and minified.

Usage
---

### Requiring

The loader is simply a custom ES6 module loader, and can be used as one:

```javascript
  jspm.import(['some', 'modules'], function(some, modules) {
  });
```

### Setting the baseURL

Just like RequireJS, provide configuration by setting the `jspm` global variable before the script is loaded, or call the `jspm.config` function:

```javascript
  jspm.config({
    baseURL: 'http://www.mysite.com'
  });
```

### Loading Global Scripts

When loading a global script, any global variables declared are returned on the module object by the `import` function.

some-global.js:
```javascript
  window.globalVar = 'hello';
  this.anotherGlobal = 'world';
```

```javascript
  jspm.import(['some-global'], function(someGlobal) {
    console.log(someGlobal.globalVar);
    console.log(someGlobal.anotherGlobal);
  });
```

Global script dependencies can be set using the [shim configuration](#shim-configuration). The global variables declared by any dependencies will then be present on the global object.

When setting global script dependencies, the globals are carefully stored and retrieved so that multiple versions of the same global name can be used by different global scripts (for example having multiple versions of jQuery). Globals never actually touch the `window` object directly, they get a carefully managed global object passed into them ensuring the `window` object remains unchanged.

### Loading CommonJS & AMD

When loading a script that contains `AMD` or `CommonJS` module syntax, the loader will detect these statements and treat any imports and exports accordingly.

amd.js:
```javascript
  define(['./some-dep'], function(dep) {
    return { property: 'object' };
  });
```

cjs.js:
```javascript
  var dep = require('./some-dep');

  exports.property = 'object';
```

```javascript
  jspm.import(['cjs'], function(cjsModule) {
    // ...
  });
```

### AMD Compatibility

The goal is to support as much of the RequireJS test suite as possible.

To create the `requirejs` and `require` globals as AMD globals, simply include the following `<script>` tag immediately after the inclusion of the jspm loader:

```html
  <script>
    require = requirejs = jspm.require;
  </script>
```

This should replicate much RequireJS functionality, and more will be covered in future.

### Loading ES6

Modules defined with ES6 syntax will be parsed with the Esprima harmony parser, which is downloaded as needed.

es6.js:
```javascript
  import { dep as d } from './some-dep';

  export var exportName = 'value';
```

When in a production environment, the goal would be to use a build system that would rewrite this in ES5 with something like the following.

es6-built.js:
```javascript
  (function() {
    var d = System.get('normalized/some-dep').dep;
    System.set('normalized/name', new Module({
      exportName: 'value'
    }));
  })();
```

### Map Configuration

```javascript
  jspm.config({
    map: {
      'jquery': 'lib/jquery',
      'backbone': 'lib/backbone/backbone'
    }
  });
```

Map configuration simply provides an alias, so that any require of the form `jquery` or `jquery/sub-module` will resolve to `lib/jquery` and `lib/jquery/sub-module` respectively.
Relative paths of the form `./dependency` within modules will be respected with the map config, just like in RequireJS.

Contextual map configurations are also supported, allowing path-specific maps just like RequireJS.

```javascript
  jspm.config({
    map: {
      'some/module': {
        'jquery': 'lib/jquery-1.8.3'
      }
    }
  });
```

This is useful for multi-version support.

### Package Shorthand

Often, when storing modules in separate folders, one ends up repeating requires like `jspm.import('some-module/some-module')`, since the main entry point name is often the module name.

To provide a simple shorthand for this, the package shorthand is simply to use `jspm.import('some-module/')`, which will result in an equivalent load.

### Shim Configuration

Shim configuration allows dependencies to be specified. It can be applied to scripts using any module format to enforce dependencies.

In this way, one can load a global script naturally like any other script. This process is done automatically.

Example:

```javascript
  jspm.config({
    shim: {
      'bootstrap': ['jquery']
    }
  });
  jspm.import('bootstrap');
```

### Locations

Custom `locations` can be defined, allowing loading from separate base folder locations.

```javascript
  jspm.config({
    baseURL: 'http://mysite.com/js'
    locations: {
      'lib': 'http://mysite.com/lib',
    }
  });

  jspm.import('lib:some-module');
```

Imports within a module from another location will have their global dependencies loaded from that same location.

Thus an import of `jquery` inside `lib/some-module.js`, will resolve to `lib/jquery.js` instead of `js/jquery.js`.

Locations can be mapped with map configuration, just like any other resource.

### ondemand

The `ondemand` functionality as provided by the `System` loader in the modules spec, is provided equally for the loader, allowing definition scripts to be routed on resolution.

```javascript
  jspm.ondemand({
    'jquery': 'http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js'
  });
```

### Transpiler Plugins

Transpiler plugins are supported for loading templates or languages that compile to JavaScript.

These are different from RequireJS in that they are extension-based plugin names:

```javascript
  jspm.import('some/module.coffee!')
```

Where `some/module.coffee` is a CoffeeScript file.

The plugin name can also be specified if not identical to the extension:

```javascript
  jspm.import('some/module.cs!coffee');
```

The plugin itself is loaded from the resource name `plugin/[pluginname]`. This `plugin` folder location or plugin itself can be mapped with standard map configuration:

```javascript
  jspm.config({
    map: {
      'plugin/coffee': 'my/coffee/plugin',
      'plugin': 'my/custom/plugins/folder'
    }
  });
```

### Writing a Plugin

lib/plugins/coffee.js:
```javascript
  var CoffeeScript = require('./coffee-script');

  module.exports = function(name, url, fetch, callback, errback) {
    fetch(url, function(source) {
      callback(CoffeeScript.compile(source));
    }, errback);
  }
```
